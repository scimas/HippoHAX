As work will begin on the Blue and Yellow Metro lines, thousands of commuters must rethink how they get to work. This can range from driving a car, taking a bus, a scooter, or even walking; no matter which mode of transport is chosen, the congestion will bleed out into other modes of transport.
This project sets to understand what those effects may be and at what magnitude they may happen by leveraging open data. We used data aggregated at [opendata.dc.gov](https://opendata.dc.gov) to find patterns similar to what the experience may be like by looking at past data.
The traffic displacement will be felt for days, so it's important to discover how the city will handle this abrupt change.
