As work will begin on the Blue and Yellow Metro lines thousands of commuters must rethink how they get to work. This can range from
driving a car, taking a bus, a scooter, or even walking; no matter the what the mode of transport chosen the congestion will bleed
out into other modes of transport.
This project sets to understand what those affects may be and at what magnitude by leveraging open data. We used data aggregated at
opendata.dc.gov to find patterns similar to what the experience may be like by looking at past data. 
The traffic displacement will be felt for days, so it's important to discover how the city will handle this abrupt change.
